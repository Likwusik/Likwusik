 # Welcome to My GitHub Profile! 

Hello! I'm Anzhelika and I like Salesforce! Learning something new in this area and being able to use my skills in a real commercial project gives me great satisfaction. Therefore, I have a strong motivation and desire to become part of a team where I could grow and also take part in improving a common product. As Salesforce Developer, I offer knowledge and skills in Apex, LWC, Visualforce, SOQL & SOSL and other functionalities and platform tools. 

## Current Interests

I'm currently diving deep into Salesforce technology. Here are some of the things I'm learning:

- **Salesforce Platform:** Apex, LWC (Lightning Web Components), SOQL & SOSL, SLDS library, LWR (Lightning Web Runtime)
- **Programming Languages:** Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, SQL
- **Web Development:** HTML & CSS

## How Can We Collaborate?

I'm looking for opportunities to expand my skills through projects, collaborations, and engaging initiatives. If you have interesting projects or ideas I could contribute to, or if you'd like to collaborate, please feel free to reach out!

Feel free to explore my repositories and get in touch!
